# codes-data-parsing
A data parsing library in Android for parsing data obtained for codes such as barcodes and QR codes into structured data.

## What is this library for?
Some barcode scanning libraries, such as ZXing, only return the text form of the barcode.  

However, there may be useful data inside - refer to https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Barcode-Contents - in which client applications need to individually parse.  

This library is to parse the result of various barcode scanning libraries e.g. ZXing, and return them in a structured form.  

This can be a replacement (albeit not a drop-in replacement) for ML Kit's data types, where the data is already parsed for you, ready for your use.

## Usage
Library is in development.  
Will be updated soon.
